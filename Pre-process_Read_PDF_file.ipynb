       "' \\nChapter One - 3 riffs, and putting them together made really fine music. His friends find this very impressive, and Spike can\\'t wait to learn more.  What have these three piano teachers communicated to their students? Grady\\'s teacher taught him to dislike studying piano, that playing the piano was hard work and no fun. Grady probably also learned that studying music is a pain and should be avoided in the future. He may avoid trying out for the band or chorus in school, and he may have already learned to associate music itself with unpleasantness so that he will not even choose to listen to much music as he grows older. Since it is very unlikely that these were the objectives of Grady\\'s teacher, we must question that teacher\\'s ability to utilize the instructional communication process effectively. Roxanne\\'s teacher was somewhat more effective. Roxanne learned that music can be fun and enjoyable, but she also learned that she had very little musical ability. Her self-esteem as a musician is low. It is unlikely Roxanne will take any more music lessons, piano or otherwise. She also is unlikely to take the risk of looking bad by joining the band or the chorus in school later. But she is likely to appreciate listening to music. She may even be willing to sign up for music appreciation classes. Certainly, she will collect albums in the future. If Roxanne\\'s teacher\\'s goal was to teach her to play the piano, the teacher wasn’t successful. However, if the goal was to get Roxanne to enjoy music, the goal was achieved. Future teachers will not have to deal with a student who dislikes music, but they may have a difficult time getting Roxanne to try performing again. Spike\\'s second teacher certainly was more successful with the instructional communication process than his first one. Spike likes playing the piano and wants to learn more. He is \"ready\" for that or another teacher to guide him to higher levels of learning. However, Spike may now associate his ability to play the piano with peer respect, so we don\\'t know how he will respond if he plays something for them that is \"sophisticated\" or \"high brow,\" and they do not like it. Nevertheless, this teacher has demonstrated effective use of the instructional communication process.  Within these examples, there are several variables at work: the teacher, the content of the lessons, the instructional strategy, the student, feedback or evaluation, and the learning environment or context in which instruction occurs. Working together, these elements define the instructional communication process.    '"
